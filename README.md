# Interference
## Inspiration
"Wave interference" is a phenomenon I recently studied at school that caught my interest.

## What is a wave interference ?
It is a phenomenon that occurs when two electromagnetic waves combine by summing their displacements at every point in space and time to generate a resultant wave of higher, lesser, or equal amplitude. This Interaction produces both constructive and destructive interference.

## A solo project
Simulated this phenomenon using two sources, contour functions, as well as importing a matplotib animation.
